# TBD-Fabric-

TBD meaning to be decided. The mod is made using Fabric.  
Minecraft Version: 1.15.1  
Note: I'm new to Git, GitHub, Java, and Fabric.  

## Features

- Ruby Ore (w/ Ruby counterpart) (ITEMS WIP)  
- Sapphire Ore (w/ Sapphire counterpart) (ITEMS WIP)  
- Separator (FUNCTIONS WIP but it can store milk)  
- Milk (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)
- Block of Charcoal (CRAP TEXTURE BUT FULLY FUNCTIONAL)  
- Charcoal/Coal Chunklet (ALSO MAYBE NOT THE BEST TEXTURES BUT FULLY FUNCTIONAL)  

## To-Do

- ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
